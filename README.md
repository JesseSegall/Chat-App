# Chat-App
A ChatApp for Android devices. This is the final project for Steven's Institute of Technology class CS522 for the MSc CS program.
This chat app allows users to create their own chat rooms that are uploaded to a cloud server using AWS. The messages and chat rooms are stored in the database so that all messages and chat rooms will persist even after the user closes and opens the app.
